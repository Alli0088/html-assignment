        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <blockquote><b>Artists who use Apps such as Procreate and Adobe Illustrator inspire me to grow design and animation skills. - <cite>Lili</cite></b></blockquote>
        <p>I am a digital artist with an interest in motion graphics and graphic design looking to grow my web design and development skills in this course. I've had creative interests my whole life, consisting of visual arts such as painting, animation, and photography. My goal by the end of this semester on December 14<sup>th</sup> is to have more knowledge of growing my own websites, and hopefully I'll have learnt more about digital graphics, camera and photo editing skills, and communicate effectively through design.</p>
